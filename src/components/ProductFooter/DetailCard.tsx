      </h2>
      <p className="text-black text-sm not-italic font-normal mb-4  leading-6">
        ON Double Rich Chocolate 5Ibs is the best support for a rigorous and

        <li className="text-black text-sm not-italic font-normal   leading-6">
          <span>Improved protein consumption for muscle recovery:</span> With
          every serving of ON whey protein, you get 24g of protein blends. The
          fast-acting proteins, namely the whey protein isolates and
          hydrolysates are absorbed instantly after training. This replenishes
          the amino acids which you lose when you workout or engage in any
          strenuous physical activity. Gold Standard Whey Protein 2.27 kg Double
          Rich Chocolate also contains important amino acids like BCAAs,
          Glutamine and Glutamic Acid which are readily absorbed by the muscles
          to help them recover faster
        </li>
        <li className="text-black text-sm not-italic font-normal leading-6">
          <span>Helps retain muscle tone:</span>
          Whey concentrate, which is included in the formula, is a
          slow-digesting protein. It releases amino acids slowly into your
          system, helping your muscles when there are long intervals between
          meals. Muscle loss is an issue which keeps you from reaching your
          goals and delays progress. ON Gold Standard Whey 2.27 kg Double Rich
          Chocolate is also one of the best snack options as it gives you the
          necessary boost of amino acids to prevent your muscles from breaking
          down.
        </li>
        <li className="text-black text-sm not-italic font-normal leading-6">
          <span>Helps you lose weight:</span>
          Weight loss is the result of increased protein consumption and
          improved sports performance. Protein keeps you feeling fuller for
          longer and helps manage food cravings better. With better stamina and
          ability to train, you are also able to push yourself harder at the
          gym. The most important advantage for weight loss is the increase in
          calorie consumption when you increase your protein consumption.
          Protein is harder to digest and requires more calories.
        </li>
        <li className="text-black text-sm not-italic font-normal leading-6">
          <span>Strengthens immune response:</span>
          Bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts often suffer from the issue of
          compromised immunity. This is because of the wear and tear that their
          muscles undergo which may lead to some inflammation, redirecting the
          immune response. With ON Whey 5Ibs Double Rich Chocolate you have the
          dual benefits of faster muscle recovery and higher protein
          consumption. This protein powder helps in the restoration of the
          immune cells and boosts the production of antibodies which keep safe
          from common health issues.
